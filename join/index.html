    <h2 id="how-to-join">How to join</h2>
<p>We are normally limited by number of expert helpers and individual exercise leaders, thus we have two options:</p>
<h3 id="zoom-registration">Zoom registration</h3>
<p>In Zoom, we group attendees into teams, with an exercise leader.  This
is a very interactive workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.</li>
<li>Complete teams are preferred: one exercise leader and 4-6 learners:
<ul>
<li>Everyone on the team must register separately.</li>
<li>Decide on a team name, and provide it when registering,
so that we can link teammates together.</li>
<li>During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the exercise leader has
primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
Still, instructors/expert helpers drop by to check and help
as needed, so don't worry if as an exercise leader you don't know everything.</li>
<li>This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
and prepare for the future together. If you will work together later,
learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you routinely use Git and know Python somewhat well or you've been to
a CodeRefinery before, you are definitely capable of being an exercise leader and register as one!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attend-via-live-stream">Attend via live stream</h3>
<p>The promise of the Internet is that we can reach everyone, so why
don't we?  So, we have a live stream
(<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitch.tv/coderefinery">twitch.tv/coderefinery</a>) option so
that anyone may attend
the workshop, even if we don't have resources to provide interactive
breakout rooms.  The live stream option is also good if you want to
passively see what we are talking about, but don't want to take an
interactive Zoom seat.</p>
<p>Breakout rooms are not streamed, you'll do exercises by yourself.
We'll often go over the exercises on stream, though.  You <em>will</em> be
able to ask us questions, and we recommend that you form your own team and do
exercises together.  We will support this as much as we can!</p>
<h3 id="price-and-zoom-priority-policy">Price and Zoom priority policy</h3>
<p>The course is free of charge, funded by the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://neic.no/">Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>When we have more sign-ups as <strong>individual learners</strong> than our capacity allows, the following priority criteria apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>National universities or research institutes in Nordic countries and Estonia</li>
<li>Private companies and government agencies in Nordic countries or Estonia</li>
<li>European national universities or research institutes from outside the Nordics.</li>
<li>Others</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore it is very important that you use an email address
corresponding to your affiliation.  If you aren't accepted to the Zoom
session, you can always attend the stream part.</p>
<p>If you come as a <strong>complete team</strong> (i.e. including at least one
exercise leader that can attend all the days), we will accept you up
to the technical capacity of our meeting.  Same for <strong>exercise
leader</strong> and other learners they bring with them (to combine with
others).</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>We hope that everyone can attend and learn from this workshop, but we
aren't perfect.  Our attempts are mentioned below, if you would like
to help or there is something else we can do, please get in touch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakout rooms with exercise leaders gives a community atmosphere
and private help.</li>
<li>Our material is provided in writing (lesson websites), by voice, and
by demo.</li>
<li>We record videos and post the notes so you can review at your own
pace later on.  Videos don't include audience voice or video.</li>
<li>HackMD allows anyone to ask questions anonymously and
asynchronously, without interrupting others.  On the other hand,
there are a <em>lot</em> of questions, so don't let it distract you from
the main lecture.</li>
<li>Lesson websites/HackMD use standard web technologies, so that
browser accessibility plugins can be used.</li>
<li>We have figures in some lessons which are somewhat important,
without good alt text.  We are working on this, contributions
welcome.</li>
</ul>
